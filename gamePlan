HTML
Game board: 
Container - fixed width height
7 divs for rows
within each row 7 divs/spans
top row chooses column to drop in, other rows
unclickable
Game piece: 
one potential approach: bg color rounded? (might round off the box)
another approach: append a CSS gamepiece, 
another approach: each gameboard box has a white colored piece in it, changes color based on which player is moving
JS
array of arrays - 
[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
[0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
[0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
[0,0,0,0,0,0,1],
[0,0,0,0,0,0,1]
[0,0,0,0,0,0,1]
[0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]
e.g. starting from last array, check if arr[n][6] = 0,1,2, if not 0, n--
win conditions:
e.g. vertical win arr[6][6]=1  arr[5][6]=1  arr[4][6]=1  arr[3][6]=1
horizontal win arr[6][0]=1  arr[6][1]=1  arr[6][2]=1  arr[6][3]=1
diagonal win arr[6][6]=1 arr[5][5]=1 arr[4][4]=1 arr[3][3]=1
CSS
class for drop in row
class for non-interactive gameboard (no pointer events)
class for red piece
class for blue piece
flow of the game:
player 1 clicks a top row element which sets a nested array value
loop is fixed based on which top row element is selected, loop thorugh each nested array from the back of the overall array based on 0,1,2
checking for a winner:
tracking total counts of moves, min must be 8
call a function checkWinner();
-checks vertical, horizontal, diagonal wins for either player 1 or player 2
functions that would be useful:
checkWinner(); -> potentially break out into 3 separate check functions
dropPiece();
